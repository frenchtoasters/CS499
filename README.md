# Keeneland Concours Map Website


Here we will explain how to use and navigate this mobile website app.

From the home page, there are three options for a user to select:  Map, Info, and Help.

			click yes.  This will bring a marker to the map that shows "You Are Here."  This will allow you to see where you are in relation to other areas of the map.  The map starts generally over the whole event and there is a legend just below the map.  Click a polygon and the map will zoom to that area and in some cases will let you select a more defined polygon that will zoom in further to show that specific location.
